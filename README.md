Welcome to geocold, a computational geometry library written in C++ 20.

The library provides primitives for all geometric constructs 
such as points, lines, spheres, cricles, etc., in _'Dim'_ dimensional 
space and implements several common geometric algorithms that 
occur frequently in computer graphics.
